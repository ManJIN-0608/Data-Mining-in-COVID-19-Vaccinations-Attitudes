# Data-Mining-in-COVID-19-Vaccinations-Attitudes
Using association mining, decision trees, neural networks, and logistic regression technologies, this report uses ANU poll 35 (August 2020): COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors (wave 3) as the data source to forecast people's attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination.

Although billions of dollars will be invested in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the arrival of these expected vaccines does not guarantee the acceptance of the vaccine. To increase vaccine trust in general practice, the government must invest in learning about the factors that influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and developing measures with the community to maximize absorption once these vaccines are accessible. This report found that those with high confidence in Australian institutions and high satisfaction with the direction of life and national development tend to receive vaccines, and those who have COVID-19 experience, such as have a COVID-19 testing, also have higher willingness. However, mental health has negligible effect on vaccine attitude.
